As an aspiring psychologist, I'm passionate about understanding the complexities of the human mind and using that knowledge to make a positive impact on people's lives.\n\nMy personality type is *INFJ*, which means I'm not only empathetic but also driven to help and support others in their personal growth and well-being. This innate quality fuels my dedication to my studies and my future career in psychology.\n\nWhen I'm not immersed in my academic pursuits, I find joy in the art of *dance* and the magic of *movies*. Dance allows me to express myself creatively and stay physically active, while movies offer a window into different worlds and human experiences. Both of these passions provide a delightful escape and a source of inspiration in my life.\n\n## My volunteering experience...\n\n## Dance and Movies...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
