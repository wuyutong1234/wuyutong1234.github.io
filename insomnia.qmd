Vincent van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo and other correspondences often mentioned his struggles with sleeplessness. In his letters, Van Gogh described periods of intense creative energy and productivity, during which he would paint through the night. His insomnia and mental health challenges are believed to have influenced both the subject matter and the expressive, emotive style of his artwork.

Van Gogh's famous painting "The Starry Night" is often thought to reflect his turbulent emotions and the hallucinatory effects that may have been associated with his experiences of insomnia. This fact underscores the complex interplay between mental health, creativity, and the sleep patterns of influential figures throughout history.

**Insomnia** is a common sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or experiencing non-restorative sleep despite having the opportunity for adequate sleep.
