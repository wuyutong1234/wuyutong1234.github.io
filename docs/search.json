    "text": "I’m Yutong, a psychology student at the National University of Singapore (NUS). As an aspiring psychologist, I’m passionate about understanding the complexities of the human mind and using that knowledge to make a positive impact on people’s lives.\nMy personality type is INFJ, which means I’m not only empathetic but also driven to help and support others in their personal growth and well-being. This innate quality fuels my dedication to my studies and my future career in psychology.\nWhen I’m not immersed in my academic pursuits, I find joy in the art of dance and the magic of movies. Dance allows me to express myself creatively and stay physically active, while movies offer a window into different worlds and human experiences. Both of these passions provide a delightful escape and a source of inspiration in my life.\n\n\nwaiting for the content…\n\n\n\nwaiting for the content…"

The goal is to provide users and viewers of the interactive data with a sense of connection at the demographic level and to inspire them with a range of coping techniques.\nWhat are the data sources that I have curated so far?\nI will be examining the primary factors that lead to insomnia, exploring its effects on health, and evaluating the effectiveness of coping strategies, all while considering variations across different age groups and genders.\nweek 10\nWhat is the question that I am going to answer?\nWhat is the gender and age disparity in insomnia (severity, causes and coping skills) in young adults?\nWhy is this an important question?\nSleep is a fundamental component of our lives, intricately linked to our mental well-being and daily functioning (NIH, 2022). Nevertheless, the issue of insomnia has risen to concerning levels, with a significant increase in sleep-related problems observed in young adults, going from 22.6% in 2010 to 30.5% in 2018 (Sivertsen, B. et al, 2019). In contrast to the commonly held belief that older adults experience more sleep difficulties than their younger counterparts, research indicates that insomnia affects over 1 in 4 individuals aged 18 to 24, with 29% experiencing it every night, making this age group the most vulnerable in the United States (Helsestart, 2022). Through an examination of the underlying causes of insomnia across different age groups and genders, we can unveil the distinctive challenges that this population faces today and explore effective approaches to address these concerns.\nWhich rows and columns of the dataset will be used to answer this question?\nAll rows with valid data entry are used (86 rows after data cleaning).The columns used are categorised into 4 main groups: participants info, severity of insomnia, causes of insomnia and coping skills.\nparticipants info: Group, SubGroup, Sex, Age\nseverity of insomnia: ISI_total\ncauses of insomnia: BDI_total, ASHS_total, ASHS_physiological, ASHS_cognitive,ASHS_emotional, ASHS_SleepEnvirnmont, ASHS_DaytimeSleep, ASHS_substances, ASHS_bedtimeRoutine, ASHS_sleepStability, ASHS_BedroomSharing, DBAS_total, FIRST_total, GCTI_total, NEO_neuroticism, NEO_extraversion, NEO_openness, NEO_agreeableness, NEO_Conscientiousness, ACE_tot, asq_home, asq_school, asq_attendance, asq_romantic, asq_peer, asq_teacher, asq_future, asq_leisure, asq_finance, asq_responsibility\ncoping skills: cope_disengage_su, cope_growth, cope_disengage_mental, cope_emotions, cope_socialsupp_instr, cope_active, cope_denial, cope_religion, cope_humor, cope_disengage_emo, cope_restraint, cope_socialsupp_emo, cope_acccept, cope_suppression, cope_planning\nThe challenges and errors that I faced and how I overcame them.\nchallenge 1: unable to publicise the app (when all workings on data cleaning and graph plotting is done on a R markdown file, app.R can still show on local host because information required is found in the workspace. However, when trying to publicise the app, it will not work)\nsolution: transfer all codes, including library(tidyverse), read.csv(), and data cleaning to app.R file so that when running the app, data files can be accessed.\nchallenge 2: for my eventual data visualisation, I need to use a lot of variables from the data set and a lot of them have specific qualities which make it very messy to manipulate them\nsolution: I tried to regroup and recategorise them by assigning 4 big titles: participants, sleep quality, casues, and coping skills; subsequently creating 4 different datasets. Within each group, there are also smaller groups like ASHS_total (Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale) and distinct categories of ASHS (eg. cognitive domain, emotional domain). I will further organise them by creating subgroups of data."
